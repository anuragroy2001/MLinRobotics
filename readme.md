# 7-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation with Gymnasium and Mujoco

This project simulates a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm using the Gymnasium framework and the Mujoco physics engine. The setup includes a customized push task environment, where the robotic arm interacts with a golf ball and a target.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python version 3.9 or above

### Libraries Used

The following libraries are required:

- **Gymnasium + Gymnasium Robotics**: For environment creation and interaction with agents.
- **Mujoco**: For physics-based simulations involving robotics.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data management.

#### Running the Project

To run the project :
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
- Run the setup script to register the environment and run the          simulation for 1000 steps with random actions.

Please run the project by running the setup.py file!!


Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install gymnasium[robotics] mujoco numpy
